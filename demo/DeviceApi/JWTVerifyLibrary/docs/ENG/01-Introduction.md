## What is JWT?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The information is digitally signed, which allows verification of its authenticity and integrity.

JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes. When a user logs into a system, the server creates a JWT, and this token is used to verify the user's identity in subsequent requests.

## Why JWTVerifyLibrary Was Created

As the importance of security in web applications continues to grow, JWT validation has become a crucial security component in modern web applications. However, implementing it correctly can be challenging. JWTVerifyLibrary was developed as a solution to this challenge.

This library was created to:
- **Simplify** the JWT validation process
- **Reduce** security risks
- **Shorten** development time
- **Prevent** code duplication
- Provide a **standardized** approach

## Core Features

JWTVerifyLibrary offers the following core features:

1. **Token Validation:** Checks the authenticity, integrity, and validity of JWTs.
2. **Middleware Integration:** Easily integrates with the ASP.NET Core pipeline.
3. **Simple Configuration:** Configuration through appsettings.json file.
4. **Claims Extraction:** Extracts user information from tokens.
5. **Security Checks:** Detects expired tokens, invalid signatures, or incorrect audiences.

## Use Cases

JWTVerifyLibrary is ideal for the following use cases:

- **API Security:** Protect your RESTful APIs with JWT-based authentication.
- **Microservice Architecture:** Ensure secure communication between services.
- **SPA Applications:** Backend security for Single Page Applications.
- **Mobile APIs:** Secure API access for mobile applications.
- **B2B Integrations:** Secure data exchange with business partners.

## Library Philosophy

The design of JWTVerifyLibrary adheres to the following principles:

- **Simplicity:** Should be usable without complex configuration.
- **Security:** Should follow security best practices and standards.
- **Flexibility:** Should be usable in different projects and scenarios.
- **Performance:** Should be optimized to not impact system performance.
- **Maintainability:** Should follow code quality and documentation standards.

## Supported Platforms

JWTVerifyLibrary supports the following platforms:

- .NET 8.0 and above
- ASP.NET Core 8.0 and above
