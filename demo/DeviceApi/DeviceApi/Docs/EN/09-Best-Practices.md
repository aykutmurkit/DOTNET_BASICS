This document provides guidance on best practices for working with DeviceApi to ensure optimal performance, security, and maintainability.

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Token Management**: Store tokens securely and never expose them in client-side code or URLs
- **Token Refresh**: Implement token refresh logic to handle expiring access tokens
- **Least Privilege**: Only request the permissions your application needs
- **Role Separation**: Create separate roles for administrators, operators, and readers
- **Always Use HTTPS**: Never send credentials or tokens over unencrypted connections

### Data Protection

- **Sensitive Data**: Do not store sensitive data in device metadata or custom properties
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs before sending to the API
- **Output Encoding**: Encode any API responses that contain user-generated content
- **Device Credentials**: Rotate device credentials periodically
- **Personal Data**: Hash or encrypt any personally identifiable information (PII)

### Attack Prevention

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent account lockouts
- **Request Signing**: Consider signing API requests for additional security
- **Replay Protection**: Include timestamps or nonces in sensitive operations
- **CSRF Protection**: Use anti-CSRF tokens for browser-based applications
- **Error Handling**: Never expose detailed error information to end users

## Performance Best Practices

### Request Optimization

- **Batch Operations**: Use batch endpoints for bulk operations when available
- **Pagination**: Always use pagination for collection endpoints
- **Field Selection**: Use field selection parameters to limit response size
- **Compression**: Enable gzip or Brotli compression for API requests/responses
- **Conditional Requests**: Use ETags and conditional requests to reduce data transfer

### Caching

- **Response Caching**: Cache API responses according to their Cache-Control headers
- **Resource Caching**: Cache frequently accessed resources like device configurations
- **Invalidation Strategy**: Implement proper cache invalidation when resources change
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Consider using stale data while fetching fresh data in background
- **Cache Hierarchies**: Implement multi-level caching for different data types

### Connection Management

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections when making multiple requests
- **Persistent Connections**: Use keep-alive for persistent connections
- **Request Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for API requests
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
- **Circuit Breakers**: Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

## Integration Best Practices

### API Client Design

- **Client Libraries**: Use or build client libraries that handle common concerns
- **Logging**: Log all API interactions for troubleshooting
- **Metrics Collection**: Track API call performance and success rates
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- **Serialization**: Use appropriate serialization libraries for JSON processing

### Webhook Handling

- **Signature Verification**: Always verify webhook signatures
- **Idempotency**: Process webhooks idempotently to handle potential duplicates
- **Async Processing**: Process webhook payloads asynchronously
- **Persistence**: Store webhook payloads before processing
- **Queue Management**: Use queues to manage webhook processing load

### Deployment Considerations

- **API Versioning**: Explicitly specify API versions in your requests
- **Environment Separation**: Use separate API credentials for development and production
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for API availability and performance
- **Alert System**: Set up alerts for API errors and performance degradations
- **Documentation**: Keep internal documentation up-to-date with API changes

## Device Management Best Practices

### Device Registration

- **Unique Identifiers**: Use globally unique identifiers for all devices
- **Device Metadata**: Include comprehensive metadata during device registration
- **Grouping Strategy**: Develop a consistent strategy for grouping related devices
- **Lifecycle Management**: Define clear device lifecycle stages (provisioning, active, decommissioned)
- **Bulk Registration**: Use batch registration for deploying multiple devices

### Data Collection

- **Sampling Rate**: Choose appropriate data sampling rates for your use case
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate data on the device when possible to reduce payload size
- **Timestamp Precision**: Use consistent timestamp formats and time zones
- **Batching**: Batch data points when sending multiple readings
- **Prioritization**: Prioritize critical data in bandwidth-constrained environments

### Firmware and Updates

- **Version Tracking**: Keep track of device firmware versions
- **Staged Rollouts**: Implement staged rollouts for firmware updates
- **Rollback Capability**: Always maintain the ability to rollback to previous versions
- **Update Verification**: Verify the integrity of updates before and after installation
- **Testing**: Test updates thoroughly in a staging environment before production deployment

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Security Anti-Patterns

- **Hardcoding Credentials**: Never hardcode credentials or tokens in your codebase
- **Excessive Permissions**: Avoid requesting or granting more permissions than needed
- **Ignoring Certificate Validation**: Never disable SSL/TLS certificate validation
- **Insecure Storage**: Don't store tokens or sensitive data in local storage or cookies without protection
- **Security by Obscurity**: Don't rely on obfuscation as your main security mechanism

### Performance Anti-Patterns

- **N+1 Queries**: Avoid making multiple requests when a single batch request would suffice
- **Polling Abuse**: Don't poll excessively when webhooks or long-polling are available
- **Ignoring Pagination**: Never attempt to retrieve all resources without pagination
- **Redundant Requests**: Avoid requesting the same data repeatedly without caching
- **Synchronous Processing**: Don't block the main thread with synchronous API calls

### Integration Anti-Patterns

- **Version Pinning**: Avoid hard-pinning to specific API versions without a migration plan
- **Ignoring Status Codes**: Always check and handle HTTP status codes appropriately
- **Silent Failures**: Don't silently ignore API errors
- **Direct Database Access**: Never bypass the API to directly access the database
- **Tightly Coupled Code**: Avoid tightly coupling your business logic to the API client

### Device Management Anti-Patterns

- **Inconsistent Naming**: Avoid inconsistent device naming or identification schemes
- **Unstructured Metadata**: Don't store unstructured or arbitrary data in device metadata
- **Overloading Custom Properties**: Avoid using custom properties for core device attributes
- **Excessive Data Transmission**: Don't send data more frequently than necessary
- **Neglecting Device Lifecycle**: Don't neglect to manage the complete device lifecycle
